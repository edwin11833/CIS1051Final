#**Random Restaurant Finder**

The Random Restaurant Finder is a Python application designed for those seeking new culinary experiences or struggling to decide where to dine. Utilizing Google's APIs and a straightforward user interface, this program makes discovering restaurants effortless and enjoyable.

##**Key Features:**

*Zip Code Based Search:* Enter your zip code, and the program uses Google Maps Geolocation API to convert it into geographical coordinates, setting the search area.

*Customizable Filters:* Tailor your search with filters like cuisine type and search radius, ensuring the results meet your specific preferences.

*Google Maps and Google Places APIs Integration:* Access a vast and updated database of restaurants, providing accurate and relevant dining options.

*Random Selection Function:* Experience the thrill of discovery with a random restaurant choice from your filtered options.

*Graphical User Interface (GUI):* An intuitive and simple Tkinter-based GUI makes the application user-friendly and accessible to everyone.

*Efficient and Accurate:* The program's efficient zip code conversion and real-time data retrieval from Google's APIs guarantee precise and current results.

##**How It Works:**

Input your zip code.

The program converts it into coordinates.

Apply desired filters.

Google's APIs fetch restaurant data based on these inputs.

A random restaurant is chosen and presented to you.

##**Potential Use Cases:**

Ideal for indecisive individuals or groups.
Great for discovering new local dining spots.
Useful for travelers seeking local eats in new areas.
Encourages users to explore and try new things, even if it's a bit out of their comfort zone.
Future Enhancements:

Adding review platform integration.
Including dietary restriction options.
Incorporating restaurant reservation and ordering features.

*You need a google maps api key for the code to work*

Some of the challenges that I faced was pretty much everything. Prior to the project, I didnt know how API keys worked, how the GoogleMaps library worked, how tkinter worked, or how to scrape google maps data.
The hardest part was linking my code and functions to tkinter buttons/dropdown menus/ text boxes. Had to watch several tutorial videos on tkinter to have a simple understanding on how to link my actual program code to the GUI.
Honestly, I was terrified that I was only going to have a program that runs on your IDE without a GUI, but I just had to focus on understanding tkinter. 
The documentation for googlemaps is wonderful! Their dev website helped me out tremendously! I noticed there weren't a ton of videos on how to use the googlemaps library.
For the future, this is NOT my final version of this project, I want to expand on this, possibly add more color to the actual GUI, some pictures and more functions. In the future I plan on making a website out of this initial project. 
Thank you Professor Rosen for challenging me with this project. 


I would also like to add that although I didn't finish with my proposal all the way, which was making a web app out of my program, I WILL make one in the near future, possibly during winter break.
The end goal for this project is to expand it even more. Anywhere from adding directions to the restaurant, menus, clickable urls, pictures, videos, and maybe even some of the popular reviews.
I would eventually like to turn this into a web app or a mobile application. Although challenging, I feel great now that I've completed an actual big project like this. Looking forward to expanding this even more!
