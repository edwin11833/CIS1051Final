#You need a google maps api key for the code to work

Some of the challenges that I faced was pretty much everything. Prior to the project, I didnt know how API keys worked, how the GoogleMaps library worked, how tkinter worked, or how to do scrape google maps data.
The hardest part was linking my code and functions to tkinter buttons/dropdown menus/ text boxes. Had to watch several tutorial videos on tkinter to have a simple understanding on how to link my actual program code to the GUI.
Honestly, I was terrified that I was only going to have a program that runs on your IDE without a GUI, but I just had to focus on understanding tkinter. 
The documentation for googlemaps is wonderful! Their dev website helped me out tremendously! I noticed there weren't a ton of videos on how to use the googlemaps library.
For the future, this is NOT my final version of this project, I want to expand on this, possibly add more color to the actual GUI, some pictures and more functions. In the future I plan on making a website out of this initial project. 
Thank you Professor Rosen for challenging me with this project.
