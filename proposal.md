# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?



Restaurant Finder

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A program or website that lets you find new restaurants based on your filters, the program or website will randomly select a restaurant that matches your set filters within a radius of your location.
This will help you explore new restaurants that fit your likes.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

A program or website that lets you find new restaurants based on your filters, the program or website will randomly select a restaurant that matches your set filters within a radius of your location.
This will help you explore new restaurants that fit your likes. I would like to add a graphical spinner that has the different options that match the set filters, this will randomly select the restaurant. I'm going to scrape data from google maps to come up with a database of restaurants that include the cost, location, and type of food. Then im going to use Google maps to pin your location and give you suggestions based on your set filters for the restaurants within a reasonable radius.
Im not sure if a website will work better for this or if a program will be just fine. The random feature can be implemented by using Python's random feature; Google offers data scraping guides to get data from google maps. The list of restaurants will also come from google maps.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Website or program with a working random feature based on your selected filters. Not sure how hard google data scraping might be, so I might have to manually input the restaurants with features.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The above, plus a working UI or graphical spinner or some sort of random graphic like when you open a mystery box in Call of Duty Zombies.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The above plus google data scraping for the list of restaurants, location, your location, and features for the restaurant. All of this on a working website.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Need to learn how to data scrap from Google maps, how to make a website using a framework like Flask. Need to learn how to do graphics, probably using pygame. Need to learn how to do a random animation. Need to learn how to store user information for accounts.
