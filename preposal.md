# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

TODO
1: A program that lets you put in what type of food you're in the mood for and it randomly selects a restaurant under your set filters. The filters will be: the culture of the food, the distance of the restaurant, the cost. (Not sure if it would be possible for cheap, but is there a way that I can gather google maps data and use it in my program for cheap or free?)


2: A website that does the first idea in a spinner form with a working UI.


3: A simple website that takes in user information to make an account; then they can do blog posts on it. 


4: Discord Music bot

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

TODO
By myself

## Do you have any questions of your own?

TODO
Other than flask, are there any other frameworks that can be used to make websites?

For a regular program, if I wanted to add a spinner window, would I use PyGame? or are there other libraries that I can use?

Scraping google maps data, how would I do this?
